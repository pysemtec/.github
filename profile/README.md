## **PySemTec** - a collection of python tools for **Ontology development** and **Semantic Data** / **Semantic Web**

### Motivation
**Python** matured to a "*lingua franca*" in science is probably the most important language in numerical AI (often called "machine learning"). However, in the field of semantic technologies (knowledge graphs, ontologies, description logics, ...) Python support currently seems to be surprisingly sparse. This project – python-related semantic technologies – aims to connect people and organizations with interest both in Python and semantic technologies.

**PySemTec** tries to bridge this gap (and high demand) and tries to develop powerful tools to make working with ontologies and semantically annotated data as easy and convenient as possible.
