## **PySemTec** - a collection of python tools for **Ontology development** and **Semantic Data** / **Semantic Web**

### Motivation
**Python** matured to a "*lingua franca*" in science is probably the most important language in numerical AI (often called "machine learning"). However, in the field of semantic technologies (knowledge graphs, ontologies, description logics, ...) Python support currently seems to be surprisingly sparse. This project – python-related semantic technologies – aims to connect people and organizations with interest both in Python and semantic technologies.

Modern science relies on collaboration and exchange of data and knowledge.
This exchange of information is far from perfect: In many cases data is not well annotated and hard to understand by machines.
Experiments are often not reproducible in other labs or the wheel is reinvented, because a precise language for scientific experiments is lacking 
and searching in data is very complicated.

Many semantic tools had been developed in the first two "semantic web" phases, the late 90s and early 2000, mostly in JAVA, a confusing programming language that gained some popularity at that time.

Unfortunately there are not too many mature python based tools for ontology development, semantic (meta-)data handling and annotation.
Also common interfaces for metadata exchange and logic reasoning are missing.
Logic reasoners are behind current speed / size demands and technical possibilities.

### Resources & Communication
To facilitate exchange of knowledge and ideas and to ideally spawn cooperation, the following resources exists:

* A repository which collects projects related to both Python and semantic technologies. Feel free to contribute via submitting issues, PR or mail.
* A mailing list which serves as the canonical communication medium of the community.
* A [Gitter Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#pysemtec_community:gitter.im?utm_source=gitter) which serves as low-barrier ad-hoc communication medium. You can also join using Matrix.


**PySemTec** tries to bridge this gap (and high demand) and tries to develop powerful tools to make working with ontologies and semantically annotated data as easy and convenient as possible.
